# PQC-QFL-Model
This code implementation is used to present the results of our paper 
# "SECURE COMMUNICATION MODEL FOR QUANTUM FEDERATED LEARNING: A PROOF OF CONCEPT" 
which was invited to present for ICLR 2023 Tiny Papers.

# To run the code:
1. First liboqs and liboqs-python library needs to be installed properly.
2. main.py file contains the code to run the experiment.

## For PQC:
1. liboqs https://github.com/open-quantum-safe/liboqs.git
2. liboqs-python https://github.com/open-quantum-safe/liboqs-python.git 

Logs folder contains some results.
